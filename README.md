### 2. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my CodeAlpha Internship. It involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**, using petal and sepal measurements.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- 📊 Dataset: Iris (150 samples, 3 classes)
- 🧹 Tasks: Data Cleaning, Visualization, Model Training & Evaluation
- 🧠 Model: Logistic Regression
- ✅ Accuracy Achieved: 100%

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains **150 records** and **5 columns**:

- `sepal length (cm)`
- `sepal width (cm)`
- `petal length (cm)`
- `petal width (cm)`
- `species` (Target variable: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Train-Test Split**: 70/30
- **Accuracy Score**: `100%` (on test data)

## 📈 Key Visuals

- Pairplot (for feature relationships)
- Heatmap (for feature correlation)
- Confusion Matrix (model evaluation)

---

## 📦 Output

- All 3 species classified correctly
- Model performed with 100% accuracy on test data
